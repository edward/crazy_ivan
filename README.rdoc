= Crazy Ivan

Crazy Ivan (CI) is simplest possible continuous integration tool.

== Usage

  Create a directory where your projects will live
    $ mkdir /var/continuous-integration
  
  Place some project(s) in that directory
    $ cd /var/continuous-integration
    $ git clone git://github.com/edward/active_merchant.git
  
  Set up continuous integration for each project
    $ crazy_ivan setup  # creates example ci scripts in 
                        # each project (see How this works)
    
  
  
    $ crazy_ivan setup  # creates the ci directory, and
                        # creates a configuration file,
                        # sets a cron job to run crazy_ivan
  
  Manually run it once to check everything is ok
    $ cd /var/continuous-integration
    $ crazy_ivan /var/www/ci       # the test reports path should be
                                   # accessible via your web server
    
    $ open /var/www/ci/index.html  # or check it through your browser
  
  Set a cron job to run it every 15 minutes
    $ echo "0,15,30,45 * * * * cd /var/continuous-integration; crazy_ivan /var/www/ci" > ci.cron
    $ crontab ci.cron
  
  Note that you don’t want this running too frequently; having overlapping 
  runs is possible and would be bad.
  
  (Functionality to have this run as a web-hook is planned.)

== How this works

  * crazy_ivan is executed periodically by cron
  * crazy_ivan looks in directories one level deeper than where it’s been called
  
    => asked to run in /projects
                         /shopify
        looks in each    /liquid
        of these dirs    /active_merchant
             ========>   /active_shipping

    => within each directory, it expects four executable scripts
       to execute at the /:
       
          /shopify
            /.ci/update
                 version
                 test
                 conclusion

  * crazy_ivan first executes `update` and captures the output:
  
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      
      git pull  # Whatever your application
                # needs to do to update your
                # source from a repository
  
  * crazy_ivan then exectutes `version` and captures the output:
  
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      
      #!/usr/bin/env ruby -wKU             # Get a version hash/fingerprint/id
      puts `git show`[/^commit (.+)$/, 1]  # from your version control system
                                           #
                                           # (Note that this will be truncated
                                           #  to fit within a filename length.)
  
  * crazy_ivan then executes `test` and captures the output:
      
      #!/usr/bin/env bash
      
      rake db:migrate    # This task prepares the application
      rake test          # for running tests, then runs them

  * At each of these three steps, the output is repackaged
    into a .json file to be consumed in the directory holding
    the static html.
  
  * crazy_ivan then executes `conclusion`, passing it the same results packaged
    in the .json file used in the static html view.
