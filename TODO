* When the .ci directory scripts are missing, prompt with a 

    Create update script? [Y]/n?
  
  then ask them about the git or svn repository. Do a friendly wizard thing with nice colours.
  This should be as nice as Phusionâ€™s thing.

* TestRunner#run_script should warn or complain on empty scripts or on scripts that do not return output

* Think about using popen4 instead (fixes exit status code issue with popen3)
