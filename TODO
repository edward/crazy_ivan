* When the .ci directory scripts are missing, prompt with a 

    Create update script? [Y]/n?
  
  then ask them about the git or svn repository. Do a friendly wizard thing with nice colours.
  This should be as nice as Phusionâ€™s thing.

* TestRunner#run_script should warn or complain on empty scripts or on scripts that do not return output

* Think about using popen4 instead (fixes exit status code issue with popen3)

* What about making all setup just be:

  $ ci install [/var/continuous-integration]
  # Defaults to creating ^^^ and prompting for each project somehow

* Needs more logging; should log to system when running each project

* Add a 'periscope' web-hook with rack to run tests.

* Come up with a better executable name ("ci" is taken by RCS)

* Come up with a better way of making the scripts executable other than just chmod-755-ing them.

* Come up with a better way of dealing with the filename length issue. (Having to truncate at 240 chars right now.)

* Create example script templates for popular version control systems

* Add functionality to detect new test runs and update index.html in-browser (have a poll every 30 seconds or something on projects.json and recents.json)

* Use datejs to parse the timestamp to easily produce deltas (i.e. "Last test ran 2 days ago")

* Do something like use a file-lock to prevent overlapping runs and notify in the index.html that it's happening
