* When the .ci directory scripts are missing, prompt with a 

    Create update script? [Y]/n?
  
  then ask them about the git or svn repository. Do a friendly wizard thing with nice colours.
  This should be as nice as Phusionâ€™s thing.

* Add a 'periscope' web-hook with rack to run tests.

* Come up with a better executable name ("ci" is taken by RCS)

* Come up with a better way of making the scripts executable other than just chmod-755-ing them.

* Come up with a better way of dealing with the filename length issue. (Having to truncate at 240 chars right now.)

* Create example script templates for popular version control systems

* Add functionality to detect new test runs and update index.html in-browser (have a poll every 30 seconds or something on projects.json and recents.json)

* Use datejs to parse the timestamp to easily produce deltas (i.e. "Last test ran 2 days ago")

* Do something like use a file-lock to prevent overlapping runs and notify in the index.html that it's happening

* Write a man page with Ron: http://github.com/rtomayko/ron

* Refactor and document Syslog to have method names that actually match the syslog levels (like #error instead of #err )

* Output should look like

 exist  
create  README
create  .gitignore
create  Rakefile
create  config.ru
